# Module 5 Challenge: Pyber Ride Sharing Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

    - The purpose of this project is to extend the prior analysis by creating a summary table of the ride-sharing data by city type and create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. A report will be provided that summarizes how the data changes by city type and how it can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results:

    - As seen above, Total Rides, Total Drivers and Total Fares showed Urban cities having the most, followed by suburban cities and rural cities.  Urban cites doubled suburburban cities in both rides and fares, and even more in total drivers.  Suburban cities had about four to five times the rides and fares over rural cities, and six times over the number of drivers.

    - The average fares per ride and average fare per driver showed the opposide with rural cities collecting the most per ride and driver, followed by suburban cities, and finally urban cities.

    - As displayed above, the total fares for city types showed urban cities at the top, suburban cities in the middle and lastly rural cities.  While the amounts over time did change, it showed that the values for each stayed around the same.


## Summary: 

    Using the results above, we can provide the following recommendations to address disparities amount city types for PyBer Ride Share:

        It is recommended that PyBer consider a sign on bonus to provide an incentive to drivers to increase driver amount to rural and suburban areas.

        It is recommended that PyBer consider rasing the fare cost.

        It is recommended that PyBer perform an analysis in the market to determine the size of the market for ride share services and also determine the current competition found in those areas.
